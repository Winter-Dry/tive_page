## TIVE

### Abstract



### Error Types

![](./img/errortype.png)

<font size=7>**TIVE**</font> bin false positives and false negatives produced by a model into 7 types, including general object recognition errors and two spatial-temporal localization errors with specific focus on spatial segmentation and temporal association quality of predicted mask sequence.

### Error identification

Clear pictures are given to show errors produced by models cross all temporal length, effect of each to the evaluation metric is weighted by individually fixing oracle. Users can observe what prevents their model to achieve higher mAP.
